I am Linus, a 23-years-old computer scientist. Over the last few years I have been specializing in
devops, security and reverse engineering. I am currently doing my vocational training at bridgefield GmbH, which
includes a lot of devops and practical security as one of our system administrators.

Although my vocational training is still ongoing, I have been programming and researching for at least 10 years.
This includes game and web development, embedded programming and even OS/kernel development.

As a valve to break down stress, I am husbanding various inverts at home. Most of them being tarantulas.
A lot of love and time goes into this, as the count is climbing steadily:
- Tlitocatl albopilosum
- Harpactira pulchripes
- Brachypelma boehmei
- Acanthoscurria geniculata
- Theraphosa blondi
- Psalmopoeus irminia
- Poecilotheria regalis
- Poecilotheria sp. "Lowland"
- Poecilotheria rufilata
- Grammostola pulchra
- Brachypelma albiceps
- Pterinopelma sazimai
- Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens
- Heterometrus (an asian forest scorpion)
- Hierodula membranacea (a large mantis species from India)

Images will be added soon :)

Also, some things I like:
- Paulaner Spezi
- Lemons and limes
- Thunderstorms
- Snowy days
- Terraria and especially its Calamity mod (play it!)
- Electronics, although I am still very bad at it
