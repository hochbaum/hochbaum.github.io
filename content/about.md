I am Linus, a 24-years-old devops engineer. Over the last decade, I have learned a lot about kernels, devops and
reverse engineering. My first program dates back to 2011 :)

Currently, I am working as a software and devops engineer at bridgefield GmbH in Germany. Containers,
pipelines, Git and Linux are my bread and butter skills which I use everyday.

Terraristics are my valve to break down stress. I am husbanding various tarantulas and a ball python.
My expertise lies in my favourite tarantula family - the Poecilotheriinae; which I am also currently breeding
the hanumavilasumica species of.
