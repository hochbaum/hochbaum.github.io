I am Linus Hochbaum, a cybersecurity expert who has a passion for digital forensics, kernels and devops. My expertise heavily lies in containerization, Linux, (Free|Open)BSD, networking and the security of all those. Solving problems in complex environments by finding creative yet effective solutions is what I thrive for. On this blog, I plan to publish posts about exactly those topics.

My technology stack mainly includes:
- Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Flux, Vagrant
- TeamCity, GitHub Actions, Gitlab CI, Jenkins
- IDA, Ghidra, x64dbg, windbg, gdb
- Terraform, Ansible, Intune
- Go, Python, C, C++, shell scripting, Nim, Java, C#
- OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Arch Linux, Debian (and its derivatives)
